###### Pong

I wanted to learn a little game development and what better way to start than making Pong!

Player1 uses the arrow keys (up, down, left and right) and player2 uses A (left), D (right), W (up) and S (down).

The score is tracked when the ball goes behind the oppositions paddle. The 'Game Reset' button
will restart the game.

Enjoy and any feedback is appreciated!
